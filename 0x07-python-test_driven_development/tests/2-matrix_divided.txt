 How to Use 2-matrix_divided.py
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``matrix_divided()``.

Usage
====

>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

- Divied Matrix With Float
>>> matrix = [
...     [4.9,6.7,8.6],
...     [1.3,9.5,3.3]
... ]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3.7)
[[1.32, 1.81, 2.32], [0.35, 2.57, 0.89]]

- Divied Matrix With None
>>> matrix = None
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()

- Divied Matrix Int With Int
>>> matrix = [
...     [4,6,8],
...     [1,9,3]
... ]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 5)
[[0.8, 1.2, 1.6], [0.2, 1.8, 0.6]]

- Divied Matrix Floats With Floats
>>> matrix = [
...     [3.4,5.7,1.2],
...     [4.5,6.8,1.5]
... ]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 8.5)
[[0.4, 0.67, 0.14], [0.53, 0.8, 0.18]]

- Divied Matrix With Void
>>> matrix = []
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 8)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: The matrix must contain more than one element
